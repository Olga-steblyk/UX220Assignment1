# Research: 
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Contrasting and Comparison</h2>
<hr />
<p>In the research that I did regarding my goals, it introduced me to new perspective and other points. While reading an article, it discussed self guided learning from students (Bertolotti, G., et al., 2016) and how they benefits but also how they benefitted in other ways. The students were able to benefit through collaboration and reaching out to their peers. By building a community of some sort, the students were able to improve their education and self guided studies. This helps my point regarding community, as they often lead to new opportunities and better strengthening in what ever the activity is.

<p>In another article I read mentioned how students who had put multiple goals ahead of them would be more likely to achieve those goals. By aiming to achieve more, it creates a larger strive for the student to achieve more. But the article also contradicts my points as it mentions how its is diffcult to try to achieve more goals and its more easy to feel stressed, and burntout. In my points, it is mentioned that it's important to water all aspects of someone's life and not only look at the academic or professional parts of one life but also to not try and do everything everywhere all at once. I believe that with my goals put in place for the five years can benefit me in the future.
