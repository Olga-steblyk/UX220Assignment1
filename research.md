# Research:


<h1 style="text-align:center"> Comparing and Contrasting </h1>

In the research that I did regarding my goals, it introduced me to new perspective and other points. While reading an article, it discussed self guided learning from students (Bertolotti, G., et al., 2016) and how they benefits but also how they benefit in other ways. The students were able to benefit through collaboration and reaching out to their peers. By building a community of some sort, the students were able to improve their education and self-guided studies. This helps my point regarding community, as they often lead to new opportunities and better strengthening in what ever the activity is. 

In another article I read mentioned how students who had put multiple goals ahead of them would be more likely to achieve those goals (Fidler, S., 2005). By aiming to achieve more, it creates a larger strive for the student to achieve more. In my points, it is mentioned that it's important to water all aspects of someone's life and not only look at the academic or professional parts of one life. I believe that with my goals put in place for the five years can benefit me in the future.

With what my points contrast compared to the articles would be how they are treating portfolios created very streamed-lined and with a very minimal way to explore new ways. I am a holistic person, so in a way, all the gears have to be turning in order for things to move which contradicts what the article is saying. The articles have a very surface-level approach to better improvement of oneself,  which do not align with my beliefs and core values as a person and as a designer.
