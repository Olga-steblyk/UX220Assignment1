# Curiosity in the World
<hr />
<p> I as a person am always curious. When I was younger, I was always fascinated with encyclopedias, history books and especially maps, rarely in one consistent language. I would tell my friendly friends what my recent discoveries and intrests. I am interested in the aspect of research and how and why of information, which having a research role in UX would be something that I would want to share. Curiosity would stem beyond an academic or career sense, just having an intrest in my surroundings has helped me in the past for new opportunities and I belive that it would also help me in the future as well. I also believe that talking to some one with a passion of learning or just an intrest in the world is a great way to reflect on life and other worldly discoveries.
