# Authenticity 
<hr />
<p>Another point I would mention is to be authentic to ones self. I see it as indulging in what I love doing with out making it seem time-wasting or <q>useless</q>. With the world being very focused on academic or career success, it is very hard to have time to do passions and hobbies. I as a person like to </p>
<ul>
    <li>Art; painting, photography, & music</li>
    <li>Physical Activities; boxing & motorcycling</li>
    <li>Learning; Geography & History</li>
</ul>
<p>But another way I view it, would be staying true to who I am and my identity. Not being shy about who I am and being real with people about what kind of person I am.</p>
