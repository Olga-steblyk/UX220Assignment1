# Kindness 
<hr />

<p>Telling my friends m y first achievement is about kindness.<q><em>Kindness is often overlooked and forgotten in the world but is one of the core concepts that humans have.</em></q> I believe that kindness is infinite and forever evolving, striving to be a kinder person is something that is integral to growing and maturing. Kindness comes in any forms and is never-ending. </p>

<p> I think of this image this is a cartoon from my childhood, very similar to Winnie the Pooh. The bear was always kind and that motivated me to be kind even when life was difficult.</p>
