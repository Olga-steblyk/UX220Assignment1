# Community
<hr />
<p>While speaking to old friends, I think about the people in my life and they mean to me. Community includes a large variety of people such as family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers, even those that I see often. I wish to accomplish serving my community in ways that they help me, with out meaning to or not. As I come from a very large city, Toronto, have a sense of belonging is vital to living in the city with its full potential which includes people. With UX having the human aspect ingrained into the field, I believe that its important to interact with everyone and to understand what community can bring to the table.</p>
